{"index": 1176, "question": "A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?", "reference_answer": "2", "model_response": "Step 1: Calculate the length of chalk remaining at the end of Monday.\nThe teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday.\nRemaining chalk = 5 inches - (5 inches * 45%) = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches\n\nStep 2: Determine the daily usage rate of chalk.\nThe teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day from Tuesday onwards.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the amount of chalk used each day.\nDaily usage = Remaining chalk * 20%\nSince we are calculating the usage in terms of the remaining chalk, we will apply this percentage to the remaining chalk each day.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of days until the chalk needs to be recycled.\nWe need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to reduce to less than 2 inches.\nLet's denote the remaining chalk at the start of each day as R, and the daily usage as U.\nU = R * 20%\n\nDay 1 (Tuesday): R = 2.75 inches\nU = 2.75 inches * 20% = 0.55 inches\nR = 2.75 inches - 0.55 inches = 2.20 inches\n\nDay 2 (Wednesday): R = 2.20 inches\nU = 2.20 inches * 20% = 0.44 inches\nR = 2.20 inches - 0.44 inches = 1.76 inches\n\nDay 3 (Thursday): R = 1.76 inches\nU = 1.76 inches * 20% = 0.352 inches\nR = 1.76 inches - 0.352 inches = 1.408 inches\n\nDay 4 (Friday): R = 1.408 inches\nU = 1.408 inches * 20% = 0.2816 inches\nR = 1.408 inches - 0.2816 inches = 1.1264 inches\n\nDay 5 (Saturday): R = 1.1264 inches\nU = 1.1264 inches * 20% = 0.22528 inches\nR = 1.1264 inches - 0.22528 inches = 0.90112 inches\n\nDay 6 (Sunday): R = 0.90112 inches\nU = 0.90112 inches * 20% = 0.180224 inches\nR = 0.90112 inches - 0.180224 inches = 0.720896 inches\n\nDay 7 (Monday): R = 0.720896 inches\nU = 0.720896 inches * 20% = 0.1441792 inches\nR = 0.720896 inches - 0.1441792 inches = 0.5767168 inches\n\nDay 8 (Tuesday): R = 0.5767168 inches\nU = 0.5767168 inches * 20% = 0.11534336 inches\nR = 0.5767168 inches - 0.11534336 inches = 0.46137344 inches\n\nDay 9 (Wednesday): R = 0.46137344 inches\nU = 0.46137344 inches * 20% = 0.092274688 inches\nR = 0.46137344 inches - 0.092274688 inches = 0.369098752 inches\n\nDay 10 (Thursday): R = 0.369098752 inches\nU = 0.369098752 inches * 20% = 0.0738197504 inches\nR = 0.369098752 inches - 0.0738197504 inches = 0.2952790016 inches\n\nDay 11 (Friday): R = 0.2952790016", "predicted_answer": null, "correct": false, "scorable": false, "latency_ms": 22057.998029515147, "error": null}
